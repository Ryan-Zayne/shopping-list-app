# Shopping List SPA - With LocalStorage Sync feature
### With Create, Read, Update and Delete  functionality

This is a project I built for the purpose of learning and understanding the inner workings of react and its hooks which, in the case the one I used mainly in here is the useState hook.

## What I learnt in this project

    1. How to pass props efficiently
    2. How to update state without mutation
    3. How to lift state up
    4. A quick trial with useRef hook
    5. Proper and frequent utilization of array methods and how they help in state management
    6. Designing with Chakra UI
    7. How to use useReducer for managing complex state.
    8. How to use typescript and eslint for predictable development.
    9. How sync UI data with localstorage
