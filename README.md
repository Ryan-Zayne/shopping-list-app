# Shopping List SPA

This is a project I built for the purpose of learning and understanding the inner workings of react and its hooks which, in the case the one I used mainly in here is the useState hook.

## What I learnt in this project

    1. How to pass props efficiently
    2. How to update state without mutation
    3. How to lift state up
    4. A quick trial with useRef hook
    5. Proper and frequent utilization of array methods and how they help in state management
